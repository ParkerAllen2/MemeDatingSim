<isth <exp 1 My dear Fortunato, you are
luckily met. How remarkably well
you are looking today.

...

<exp 3 But I have received a pipe of what
passes for Amontillado, and I have
my doubts about it.

<dog <shake <exp 2 How? Amontillado, a pipe?
Impossible! And in the middle of
the carnival!

<isth As I said, I have my doubts, <exp 4 and I
was silly enough to pay the full
Amontillado price without consulting
you in the matter.

<hop

You were not to be found, and I
was fearful of losing a bargain.

<dog <shake <exp 0 Amontillado!

<isth <exp 0 I do have my doubts, though.

<dog <shake <exp 1 Amontillado!
