<theme monday <back gym <self I decided that I wanted to go get some food before heading to any of my classes, so I head to the school parking lot.
Usually students who own food trucks like to park there to generate business during lunchtime, 
so no doubt I’d be able to get something to eat.
Unfortunately when I got there almost all the food trucks have started to pack up for the day.
All except one.
The Qrusty Qrab.
I feel like I’ve heard that name before, but it seems like a work around for copyright laws
Oh well, it’s better than nothing.
I go up to the window to place an order and that’s when I see him.
<krabs <flip <pos 3 <self Mr. Eugene Krabs.
One of the most sexy looking crustaceans in the whole memiverse.
His elevated eyes…
His dad bod…
His giant crab hands…
All of the perfect crabby package wrapped into one.
My mind goes blank for a moment before Mr. Krabs finally noticed I was standing in front of his truck.

<krabs <flip Oohhh one more customer for the day, luck must be on me side! <exp 1

<self Mr. Krabs smiled widely, putting on the best customer service act he could.


<krabs So what can I get for ya?
<o Your love
<o A Qrabby Patty <skip 4

<krabs <shake <self Mr. Krabs just laughed his iconic laugh before looking back at me.
<krabs <exp 0 <aff -1 <sound down Very funny, no what will it be?
<self Dammit my pickup line didn’t work.
I just order one Qrabby patty, giving him the money in exchange for the sandwich? Burger? I don’t know which. <skip 3

<krabs <aff 1 <sound up Okay! One Qrabby Patty coming right up!
<krabs <pos 0 <self He then scurried off into the food truck, taking a few minutes before arriving back with my food. <krabs <pos 3 <self
I thank him and give him some cash I had on hand.


<krabs <exp 0 Have a lovely day me loyal customer!

<self Mr. Krabs waves to me as I head to leave, <krabs <exp 2 <flip <self before cackling and holding the money I gave him tightly to his chest.

<krabs Kekeke… I love money!

<self Damn, I wish he would hold onto me as much as he did that money.
Wait a minute... 
Why am I even walking away???
<krabs <flip <exp 3 <self I turn around and walk back to the food truck, causing Mr. Krabs to look confused.

<krabs What is it?? There are no refunds allowed if you don’t like me food.

<player No that’s not it. <krabs <exp 0 <player


<krabs Then what is it? I don’t have all day.
<o I’ll pay you if you chat with me for a bit
<o Could we talk for a bit <skip 2

<krabs <exp 1 <hop <aff 1 <sound up <self Mr. Krabs eyes lit up the moment the word pay fell out of my mouth, he instantly closed up the food truck before scurrying out of the back.
<krabs Of course I can talk to you, my time is worth a twenty per hour by the way. <skip 3

<krabs <exp 4 <shake <aff -1 <sound down <self Mr. Krabs looked unamused at the gesture, as if the mere thought of being unable to earn money insulted him.
<krabs Why should I? Are ye gonna pay me for me time?
<krabs <exp 0 <self I sigh and slide a twenty over the counter, with Mr. Krabs snatching it instantly before scurrying out to talk to me.


<krabs <flip <pos 1 So ye wanted to talk to me, about what exactly?

<player I just want to get to know you, I’ve heard a lot about you. You are a legendary meme after all.

<krabs <exp 1 <self Mr. Krabs smiled at the fact he was called a legend, making himself feel like a million bucks.

<krabs Well, the name’s Eugene Krabs. But everyone calls me Mr. Krabs. <hop This baby here is my pride and joy. She keeps the money flowing in.

He knocked his hand against the side of the food truck, sniffling like a proud dad.

<krabs <exp 0 Now how about ye? Who are ya?

<player I’m <play, I’m a gen ed student who has a… passion for meeting other memes.

<self I smile the best I can, I technically am not wrong with my word choice.

<krabs I see… so <play what do ye want to know?


<krabs I can tell ye about me business, about me schooling, whatever you want to know.
<o Tell me the secret formula to your food?
<o Tell me about your business <skip 5

<krabs <exp 3 <aff -1 <sound down <self Mr. Krabs looked like he got whiplash just from the sheer mention of having a secret formula.
<krabs Where did you hear about that??
<krabs <shake Nevermind…
<krabs <exp 0 I’ll just tell ya my life story instead.
<krabs I’m not telling ya nothin’ about that. <skip 4

<krabs <exp 0 Well it all started when I was a wee little Krab.
<krabs and I had fallen in love at first sight.
<krabs With the one true beauty of this world…
<krabs <hop <aff 1 <sound up Money.


<self Mr. Krabs proceeded to talk for literal hours about his love for money. To the point I could see that this conversation was going to go nowhere.

<krabs So <play.
<krabs How much do ya like money?

<self I look over to Mr. Krabs, who looked genuinely curious about what I was going to say.

<player Well… I can’t ever say I hate money.
<player I mean, we need it for everything in order to survive.
<player Who wouldn’t love the tool that allows them to live comfortably.

<krabs <hop Exactly!
<krabs I’m glad to see that someone agrees with me philosophy.
<krabs Without money in this world ye can’t live comfortably, so I want all the money I can get.

<self Mr. Krabs looks out to the parking lot, now empty of all other food trucks besides his own.
His competition is gone and students are coming to their cars to head home.

<krabs Excuse me <play, I got to open to get me some customers.

<krabs <pos 3 <flip <self He scurried back into the food truck, flipping it back to open as other memes began to line up for food.
Leaving me to my thoughts.
How am I supposed to get through to this sexy shellfish that I wanted to date him if all he has on his mind is money?
That’s when it finally hits me.
If I worked for him, then I could get close enough to him to make it known I’m interested in him!
I look back at the food truck, which the line for has tripled in size.


<self It seemed like Mr. Krabs started to struggle keeping up with the orders coming in.
<o Go and help him catch up with orders
<o Wait until the line dies down <skip 5

<self I shrug to myself and decide to hop inside the food truck.
Before Mr. Krabs could question what I was doing, I began to man the cash register for him to let him cook.
Causing the line to gut by much faster than it would’ve been if it was him alone.
<krabs <pos 1 <flip Thanks, although I’m not gonna pay ye for volunteering to help.
<player Eh I don’t mind <krabs <aff 1 <sound up <player <skip 7

<self I decide that it be too much trouble to try to mess with his business, as it’s something he usually deals with on his own.
So I wait for him to finish up to talk with him more…
And wait… 
And wait… 
And wait…
<krabs <pos 1 <flip <self After a long while of waiting and twiddling my thumbs for the rush to finish Mr. Krabs comes back out, looking beat.
<krabs <aff -1 <sound down That took a lot longer than expected.


<krabs <flip <self Mr. Krabs then looks around, seeing the parking lot begin to empty.

<krabs <flip Well I better get going, I need to follow where the money will take me!

<krabs <flip <self Mr. Krabs then began to pack up to head out.
This is my chance to confess to this Dilf of a crab!

<player Wait Mr. Krabs! <krabs <hop <player

<krabs <flip <exp 3 <self Mr. Krabs then turns around, with a questioning look on his face.

<player I like you!
<player Like how you like money!


<player So…
<o Please love me like you love money!
<o Please go out on a date with me! <skip 1

<krabs <aff -1 <sound down <skip 1
<krabs <aff 1 <sound up

<krabs <if 0 <skip 12

<krabs <exp 2 <self Mr. Krabs looked stunned for a second, before his eyes morphed into a flirtatious expression.
<krabs I guess we can go on a date.
<krabs Although if we do get together you’ll be second to money.
<krabs Deal?
<player Deal.
<krabs <shake <self We shake hands on it.
I got a date with the sea creature of my dreams!
The crabby money hungry daddy!
<krabs Oh and before I forget…
<krabs You still owe me money for using my time.
<self Shit.
<scene


<krabs <exp 4 <self Mr. Krabs didn’t say anything before pulling out a tiny violin and beginning to play it.
<krabs I’m sorry <play.
<krabs But money is my one true love.
<krabs pos 0 <self He quickly hopped into the Qrusty Qrab before speeding out of the parking lot as fast as he could.
Leaving me in the dust left behind.
I ruined my one chance to date Mr. Krabs.
I feel as pathetic as a Chum Bucket.
