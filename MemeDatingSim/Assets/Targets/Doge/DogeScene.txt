<theme monday <back gym <self I realized what better place to look for the meme man of my dreams than the recreational centre. 
A place in which the strongest, most masculine memes will gather to flex their amazing bods.
I head over to the recreational centre, my fantasies realized as I’m surrounded by ripped, muscular strength that is the buff memes.
But one meme has for certain caught my eye.

<Buff <pos 2 <self Buff Doge.
That rippling chest . . .
Those beefy arms . . .
Those dogey facial features . . .
The perfect good boy all wrapped into one beefcake of a package. 
Now this, this is a meme I want as my date while going to school here.


<Buff <pos 1 <self Buff Doge is seen in the back of the recreational center, bench pressing 200 pounds alongside a bunch of other memes.
<o Go over and try to bench press alongside them
<o Sit down near them and watch <skip 5

<self I decide the only way to be able to talk to this man is through the power of strength.
I go over to where Buff Doge was and pick up the heaviest thing I could bench press.
Two 10 pound weights.
I begin to try my damn hardest to bench press these weights, but then the memes that were around Buff Doge began cheering like it was a sports competition.
<Buff <aff 1 <sound up <exp 1 Hey, good job trying something new newbie! Always glad to see new people here. <skip 4

<self I sit down near the group of buff memes, just watching as they get their bodies ripped.
But this doesn’t last long as the man of the hour Buff Doge stops what he’s doing and walks over.
<Buff <aff -1 <sound down <exp 3 You know . . . we do have enough room for you to join us. You don’t have to just sit there.
<player Oh, thanks.


<Buff <exp 1 <self Buff Doge gave a wide smile and set his equipment down.

<Buff I always make sure to greet newcomers to this lovely establishment.
<Buff Usually me and the boys scare them off.
<Buff The name’s Buff Doge, but most people call me Buff to differentiate me from my twin brother, Doge. What’s your name?

<player <play . . .

<Buff Well nice to meet you <play, have a great time in this recreational centre! <exp 0

<self He walks back over to the group of memes, getting a drink of water before bantering with his friends.
As much as I’d like to try to get in shape, that’s not my main goal at the moment.

My main goal is getting a date from this Perro Grande.
<o Go over and join Buff Doge’s group
<o Start trying to use different gym equipment <skip 6

<self I get up and insert myself into the group, looking at Buff Doge with a glint of mischief in my eyes.
<Buff <exp 3 <aff -1 <sound down Uhhh . . . Hey . . . Need help over there?
<self He looks a bit uncomfortable, trying to figure out what is happening.
<player hehe . . .
Sorry . . .
<Buff <exp 0 <self I walk away sheepishly before finding a piece of equipment to start to good around with. <skip 2

<self I look around and find a punching bag I can begin to use.
<Buff <exp 1 <aff 1 <sound up <self Buff Doge notices and nods in approval of the choice.

<Buff Here, let me help you with that <play! <exp 1

<self Buff Doge trotted over, taking a hold of a punching bag and giving me a smile to signal to punch it.
Why not, I mean I want to get to know Buff more.
I begin to punch at the bag, beating it like there was no tomorrow.

<Buff <shake That’s it! Good job! <exp 0

<self After a few minutes of this… strange interaction… Buff Doge notices that his friends had left the situation.

<Buff <exp 1 Welp, guess you’re stuck with me now.

<player I guess I am.

<Buff So . . .
<Buff Are you planning on coming here regularly?
<Buff Me and the boys practically live here.

<player Most likely.
<player Although I think I’d rather watch the scenery over becoming a part of the picture if you catch my drift.

<Buff <exp 4 <self Buff Doge began to blush profusely, becoming suddenly aware that he had on no shirt.
Nor any clothes for that matter.
As he is, in fact, still a doge.

<Buff I . . . should probably go get a shirt on. <exp 0
<o Oh, ok.
<o But I like what I see. <skip 4

<Buff <aff -1 <sound down <pos 0 <self Doge runs off to the locker room.
<self Only to return later with remnants of what appears to be some tee shirts.
<Buff <pos 1 I . . .
<Buff They all ripped when I tried to put them on. <skip 4

<self Doge turned an even darker shade of red, his muscles tensing as if they were reacting to being praised.
<Buff <aff 1 <sound up <exp 2 Such appreciation…
<Buff Very wow . . .
<Buff A-Ack! Sorry I reverted back to my family’s speech habits.


<Buff <exp 1 I guess fate wants me to be forever shirtless huh?

<player Well, then I agree with fate then. <Buff <exp 0 <player

<??? Wow I can’t believe someone like you is speaking with a scrub like them Buff.

<self Both of us turn to see an irrelevant troll looking meme, standing nearby as if he owned the joint.
<??? <pos 3 <self There’s no mistaking that he’s just here to pick a fight with Buff Doge.

<??? You’re the face of buff memes Buff, don’t you have any respect for yourself when it comes to your image?
<??? I mean come on you come from a legendary bloodline.
<??? The doges are much more tasteful than tha- <pos 0 <Buff <shake

<self And . . .
Before I knew it . . .
The random ass meme was on the ground, with an imprint of Buff Doge’s fist taking up his whole face.
It took a second for the meme to figure out what just happened, his eyes widening before he scurried off.
<Buff <exp 1 Buff Doge looked content with himself.


<Buff Sorry, I just hate pompous idiots.
<o I . . . Thank you.
<o You didn’t have to do that <skip 8

<Buff <aff 1 <sound up <self Buff Doge smiles, rubbing the back of his head.
<Buff It was nothing.
<Buff I just hate <shake it that people think I have to be a top notch Doge meme because I come from a long line of Doges.
<player Hey, you being you is the best kind.
<player Even if you come from a line of “Such Doges” and “Very Memes”
<Buff Hey, We don’t all sound like that all the time.
<player But you sounded like that a while ago.
<Buff . . . True. <skip 3

<Buff <aff -1 <sound down <self Buff Doge looked a little saddened.
<Buff But I wanted to.
<Buff I hate <shake it when people get cocky just because I’m a Doge.


<Buff <exp 0 Anyways, I better get going. I may practically live here but I’m still a student here.
<Buff But I’ll see you around will I?

<player Oh of course!

<Buff <flip <self Buff Doge smiled and began to pack up his things.
But that’s when I realized . . .
My mission!
The whole reason why I came in here.
I wanted to get my buff man!

<player Wait!

<self Buff Doge stopped in his tracks, looking over at me.

<Buff <flip <exp 3 Yes <play? What is it?

<player Well, I wanna ask you something . . .

<self I swallow a bit of my pride, taking a deep breath as I look at the confused hunk of Doge.

<player Well you see . . .

<o Please become my man!
<o Please go on a date with me! <skip 1

<Buff <aff -1 <sound down <skip 1
<Buff <aff 1 <sound up

<self Doge just stares for a minute.
Slightly dumbfounded as if he is trying to process the words.

<if 0 <skip 11

<Buff <exp 2 <pos 2 <hop <self Buff doge then walks over to me, picking me up and giving a giant bear hug.
<Buff Of course I’ll go out with you!
<Buff You seem like quite the interesting character.
<Buff And I need a little spice in my life. 
<player So . . . it’s a date?
<Buff It’s a date <play.
<self My inner thoughts instantly overloaded from the sheer overjoy of hearing those words.
Not only did I get a date with a muscular beefcake of a meme.
But I got a date with a muscular beefcake of a Doge meme.
This day couldn’t get any better.
<Yuutaro <aff -1 <krabs <aff -1 <kermit <aff -1 <stonks <aff -1 <scene


<Buff <exp 4 <flip Buff doge looked a little saddened by the confession, trying to look elsewhere.
<Buff <play . . .
<Buff You seem like a fun person . . .
<Buff But I don’t really think you’re meant for meme.
Buff Doge then grabs his stuff and walks out of the recreational centre.
Although he missed the door and walked straight through the wall.
Leaving not only a buff doge shaped hole in the wall… but also in my heart.
