<theme wholesome <back cafe <self I realized quickly that my caffeine levels for the day are too low for me to function for the day, my addiction needs to be satisfied.
What better way to drink the juice that keeps me going than going over to the campus cafe.
I head over and get in line to get the pure deliciousness that is my normal coffee order, going up to the cashier and finally placing my order.

<player Hi, I would like a venti 9 shot espresso, with one pump of vanilla, skim milk, 10 splendas, no whip, no foam, with 2 squirts of honey shaken in.

<self The Barista looked terrified, but nodded and went to make my drink of pure joy.

<stonks? Pathetic.
<stonks? How dare you ruin the purity that is a good cup of coffee?

<self I look around, confused as to who the voice was as I grab my glorious concoction from the barista.

<player Who said that?

<stonks? I did.

<self I look over to where the voice came from, and there he was.
<stonks <pos 1 <self Stonks, one of the richest memes on campus.
A meme of few emotions yet has such great appeal.
His sexy suit, his beautiful bald head, his expressionless face.
I should be mad that he just insulted my drink of the gods, but the fact he even acknowledged me is enough to make me forgive him.
But Stonks didn’t look pleased with me, his arms crossed as he questioned me from his table in the cafe.


<stonks <exp 3 Well? Explain yourself.
<o I just like it that way
<o Because I wish for my insides to die more quickly <skip 2

<stonks <aff -1 <sound down How disgusting.
<stonks No one would willingly put that into their body unless they’re trying to die. <skip 3

<stonks <exp 1 <aff 1 <sound up <self Stonks had a slight smirk on his face.
<stonks I knew it.
<stonks No one would ever drink that unless they wanted to die.

<stonks <exp 0 Now, you’ve intrigued me. Come sit with me, I’d like to learn more about you.

<self My brain instantly blue screens.
Stonks . . . the Stonks . . . Asked me to sit with him????
I immediately sat down across from him, being able to admire his gorgeous low polygon face much closer than I ever imagined I’d be able to.

<stonks I believe I haven’t properly introduced myself.
<self Stonks whip out a business card, sliding it across the table.
<stonks My name is Stonks, I am part of the college of business here on campus. And I am a professional investor in the stock market. I know the economy better than the back of my hand.

<player Well, I ‘m <play. I’m currently just in gen eds as I don’t know what my major should be yet. And that’s all about me.

<self Stonks nods slowly, slow sipping his cup of black coffee that seemed to appear out of nowhere.

<stonks I see . . . Well even the most simple people can go to prestigious schools such as this one.
<stonks But having many different types of people can make things interesting.
<stonks After all, the more people going to college the more the economy can grow.

<self He leans back into his chair, taking another sip of coffee.
I can’t help but be attracted to the pure intimidation radiating off this meme. He has power, money, influence, and a hot face to add to it.


<stonks Speaking of the people, what do you think of the concept of cryptocurrency?
<o You mean Bitcoin?
<o You mean Dogecoin? <skip 2

<stonks <exp 0 <aff 1 <sound up Yes, I personally have invested in it when it first was seen as nothing more than a joke.
<stonks I have been able to invest in more than ever before because of the money I’ve made from it. <skip 3

<stonks <exp 0 <shake <aff -1 <sound down I don’t mean that one, the Doge family is growing way too strong for my tastes if you ask me.
<stonks How does one get their own cryptocurrency anyway?
<self He looks at me as if I would know the answer to that, which I merely shrug to.


<self I practically understood none of what he said, but I couldn’t help but be intrigued by the passion he was showing as he began spewing on and on about the structure of our capitalistic society. *Happy Sprite*
After a while I realized I could actually join in on his ramblings.
With the GameStop stock situation.

<player Hey Stonks?

<stonks Yes <play? 

<player What do you know about the GameStop stock situation?

<stonks <exp 3 <self Stonks looked a little confused for a second
He then realized what I was talking about, his smirk reappearing on his face.

<stonks <exp 1 Well, what do you know about it <play? I know everything about the whole situation, but you brought it up.

<self Crap. I didn’t think he’d turn the question around on me. I don’t really know what happened with the situation and was hoping he’d talk about it.
As I’m lost in thought I didn’t realize Stonks leaned in close from across the table, getting close enough to whisper into my ear.

<stonks <exp 1 Did you say that just to try to impress me? How cute.


<self My face turns bright red, my heart beginning to go a mile a minute.
<o I-It wasn’t that cute
<o Back away from him <skip 3

<self Stonks sits back down in his chair chuckling a bit to himself.
<stonks <aff 1 <sound up Sureeee <play, whatever you say.
<self Out of all the memes I’ve seen as attractive throughout my years, I didn’t believe that the serious meme that is in fact Stonks would be the most flirtatious. <skip 3

<stonks <exp 4 <self Stonks sighs a bit before sitting back down in his chair.
<stonks <aff -1 <sound down Damn… usually that move works on people.
<stonks A shame really . . .

<self Stonks takes a huge gulp of his coffee before going onto his laptop to work on whatever he was working on before having me come over to the table.
I then remembered . . .
My reason for coming here.
My elixir of life!
I got so distracted by the dom energy of this gorgeous meme man that my coffee got cold.
<stonks <shake <self I quickly chug it so I could get another, prompting a weird look from Stonks.
But I don’t care.
I get another coffee and sit back down with Stonks, who is now off his computer.

<stonks So <play . . .

<player Yes?

<stonks Would you ever be interested in learning the art of the stock market? I’d be happy to teach you all I know.
<stonks You don’t have a major, and you seem interesting enough that I’d be willing to teach you everything I know.


<stonks So what do you say?
<o That would be interesting
<o I’m not so sure <skip 3

<stonks <exp 1 <aff 1 <sound up <self Stonks smiles, feeling content with the answer I gave him.
<stonks Lovely, you’d be able to learn of the sweet ecstasy of being able to make the perfect trade when dealing with Stocks.
<self He folds his hands and puts them on the table. <skip 1

<stonks <aff -1 <sound down <exp 0 <self Stonks face becomes unreadable. Not saying anything in response.

<stonks <exp 0 I have one final question…
<stonks Is there a type of man you’re attracted to.

<self Oh no he’s on to me.
I stare at this dominating man of a meme, realizing the only reason why I sat down in the first place is because of my pure attraction to him.
I feel the blush creeping up on my face, causing Stonks to smile to himself.

<player Well I’m attracted to all types of memes.
<player Especially male memes.

<stonks I see . . .
<stonks How interesting.

<self Stonks simply shrugs in response before going onto his phone.
How could this meme take this news so nonchalantly?
Wasn’t he flirting with me this whole time?
Well I won’t let him have the last say in this.

<player Hey Stonks.

<stonks <exp 3 <self He looks up from his phone, his eyebrows furrowed.

<stonks hm?

<self I look straight into his eyes, not letting his appeal get the best of me.

<o I want to date you!
<o Do you think we could date? <skip 1

<stonks <aff 1 <sound up <skip 1
<stonks <aff -1 <sound down

<stonks <if 0 <skip 9

<stonks <exp 1 <self Stonks smiles, getting up and walking over to where I was sitting.
<stonks Why I thought you’d never ask <play.
<stonks I can’t wait to get to know you better.
<self He took my hand and kissed it before packing up his stuff.
<stonks My number’s on my card. Make sure to call me.
<stonks <pos 0 <self He walked out of the cafe, leaving me in complete and total shock.
I was able to get the hot daddy dom businessman meme to become my date.
It feels so surreal like I’m the main character in a dating sim full of hot men.
<scene


<stonks <exp 4 <self Stonks looks at me with a saddened look.
<stonks <play . . . As much as you are interesting and fun to tease, but I don’t believe we’re compatible to date.
<stonks <exp 0 You may consult me anytime on the stock market, but that’s merely it.
<stonks Now begone, I no longer require your presence.
<self I stare, dumbfounded and defeated.
All that flirting and no payoff.
I take my second coffee and leave the cafe, the coffee now cold.
I lost my one chance to get Stonks as my date. A tragedy in itsel
<scene
