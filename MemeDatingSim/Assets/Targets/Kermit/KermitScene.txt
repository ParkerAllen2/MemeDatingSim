<theme silly <back lib <self I decided that I wanted to stop by the theater that was on campus, as I heard that they were currently practicing for their next big performance.
I never really have seen the drama memes up close before, maybe it’s possible one of them will stick out to me.
I walk into the auditorium, noticing a bunch of memes scurrying around as they’re getting ready for another run of a scene.
No one too special, the only ones I could recognize from the sea of memes were Sanic, Shaggy, and Waluigi. None to which are my type.
The lights lowered and the director signaled for the scene to start.
And out walked a meme so beautiful it felt like the world stopped with him.
<kermit <pos 2 <self Kermit the Frog.
A legend in himself, with years of meme stardom on his belt.
And one of the hottest frogs I’ve ever seen in my goddamn life.
I sat down in one of the auditorium seats, mesmerized by this amphibious beaut’s performance, when all of the sudden the director cut the scene.
<kermit <pos 1 <self I see Kermit finally get off the stage, coming over to near where I was to take a break.
This is my chance!


<self I walk over to Kermit, with a wide smile on my face.
<o Nice performance over there!
<o Hey you did pretty good up there <skip 2

<kermit <exp 1 <self Kermit looked over, with a wide smile as he set down his Lipton tea.
<kermit <aff 1 <sound up Why thank you! I do try to do my best. <skip 2

<kermit <exp 3 <self Kermit looked slightly confused, as if trying to hold back that he deserved higher praise.
<kermit <aff -1 <sound down Well of course I did good, I’m the star of the show after all.

<kermit <exp 0 <self Kermit looked over to me, with a large grin on his face.

<kermit The name’s Kermit, Kermit the Frog.
<kermit And what’s your name?

<player My name is <play.

<kermit <exp 1 Well nice to meet you <play!
<self Kermit holds out his hand for a handshake, but when I went to shake his hand he grabbed it and <kermit <shake <self shook it as if it was the hand of the puppet.
Kermit then stares at the player behind the screen, laughing silently before looking back at me. <kermit <exp 0 <self


<kermit So <play, do you like the performing arts?
<o I think it looks like a lot of work
<o I think it looks interesting <skip 8

<kermit <aff -1 <sound down <exp 4 <self Kermit huffs a bit, shaking his head and looking to the ground.
<kermit Of course it’s a lot of work.
<kermit Art is work.
<kermit <exp 0 Yet the most beautiful art is the ones we put all our effort into.
<kermit <hop <self Kermit clenches his fist, looking up to the ceiling as if he’s giving the speech of a lifetime.
<kermit Without art our world becomes a bleak, desolate wasteland of nothing but compliance. Without art our abilities to express ourselves are almost entirely destroyed to the point that-
<player Ok ok I get it.
<self If I didn’t stop him there he’d probably go on for hours. <skip 7

<kermit <aff 1 <hop <sound up <exp 1 Well of course it’s interesting!
<kermit The stage is it’s own world, through it we can make anything happen.
<kermit <hop <self Kermit then gets on top of an auditorium chair, a spotlight falling onto his figure as if on command.
<kermit <exp 0 Without the art of theater, I would never be the frog that I am today. I’d merely be a puppet of the masses doing whatever they intended for me to do in their minds.
<kermit Theater is important to society as through the power of art we can inspire the masses to be whatever they want to be-
<player Ok Shakespeare I get it
<self The spotlight immediately went away the moment Kermit stopped talking, he really has control of this auditorium huh.


<self But… even with Kermit rambling on and on…
I can’t help but be attracted to a meme so engrossed into his passions.
<kermit Anyways, I should probably get back to practi-
<kermit <shake WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?!?
<self Kermit began flailing around in a frenzy, like a ragdoll being handled by a toddler.
<kermit <pos 2 <self On stage a few of the other memes had accidentally knocked over all of the props, looking dumbfounded as Kermit was all over the place.
<kermit <flip <hop <self He ran onto the stage to start trying to put everything back to the way it was. 
He even tried to sing the stage back together like in a movie he was in before.
<kermit <pos 1 <self But it was all in vain, it still was a mess.
<kermit <exp 4 <self Kermit crumpled to the floor of the stage, tears falling from his bulbous eyes.


<kermit <exp 4 It’s all over… My dreams are as good as dead.
<o Go comfort him
<o Help clean up the stage <skip 8

<self I walk over to Kermit, kneeling down next to the frog.
<player Hey it’s ok, everything is fixable is it not?
<self Kermit wipes away his tears, looking up at me.
<kermit <flip Are you sure?
<player I’m sure.
<self I hug Kermit to try to help him calm down, but once I did his personality flipped instantly to gleeful.
<kermit <hop <aff 1 <sound up <exp 1 I see, well that’s good. And I got a hug out of it too.
<self Did… Did I just get played? <skip 6

<self I walk over and begin to try to clean up the mess left behind as best I could.
<kermit <exp 3 <self But Kermit just looks up, his face scrunched up and unfazed.
<kermit <flip <shake <aff -1 <sound down Hey… I’m wallowing in sorrow over here.
<kermit <exp 4 Aren’t people supposed to cheer up those who’re sad in these situations?
<kermit <exp 0 <self Oh… I guess he wanted me to go cheer him up instead.
Well he is a theater major, those types can be a bit overdramatic.


<player Did you pretend to cry just to get me to fawn all over you? How cute.

<kermit <exp 2 <self Kermit blank stared for a second, before his face turned a shade of pink.

<self I could’ve sworn I could see little hearts floating around him too.

<kermit <exp 0 Maybe… I was a bit upset in the moment though.
<kermit But as you seemed like a fan of course I’d want you to fawn all over me.

<self He stood up, smirking a bit as sparkles danced around him like an anime boy.
What an interesting character on top of his good looks.
<kermit <shake <self Kermit proceeds to brush himself off before <kermit <flip <hop <self hopping over to the director, who had just walked in and began to panic about the stage.
Do I make a move then? If he’s being so flirty it could work in my favor.
After all, he’s the reason why I stayed here even though no one else looked interesting.

<kermit <flip Hey <play?

<self I quickly snap out of my thoughts and look to Kermit, who is now standing in front of me.

<kermit Thanks for trying to help earlier.
<kermit To show my appreciation I’ll allow you to give me a hug.
<kermit After all, who wouldn't want to hug someone famous?


<self He held out his arms for a hug, making the fact that he is a short frog much more noticeable.
<o Kneel down and hug him
<o Hug him <skip 3

<self I kneel down to his level in order to give him a hug
<kermit <shake <exp 3 <aff -1 <sound down <self Only to be greeted by a face of confusion and dread
But he still accepted the hug regardless. <skip 2

<kermit <exp 1 <aff 1 <sound up <self I hug him to the best of my abilities, with kermit looking satisfied by it.
<kermit See? Isn’t it wonderful to hug such an iconic frog?


<kermit <exp 0 <self I pull back after a couple seconds, Kermit looking satisfied.
<kermit Say <play...
<kermit Do you have feelings for me?

<self I stopped, looking at him with a bit of shock.
<self How did he figure it out?

<kermit I’ve never seen you in here before, but even so you stayed.
<kermit So tell me…

<kermit <hop <self He faked flipping back hair, a hint of mischief twinkling in his eyes.
Of course he’d figure it out.
This is Kermit the Frog.


<self The master of acting that he is would be able to pick up on subtle details like that.
<o Yes, I do
<o Nod slowly <skip 1

<kermit <aff 1 <sound up <skip 1
<kermit <aff -1 <sound down

<kermit <if 0 <skip 11


<self Kermit then began to dance in place, the spotlights going onto him like he’s the star of the show.
<kermit I knew it!
<kermit Well since we established that you have feelings for me.
<kermit Why don’t you go on a date with me?
<kermit <exp 1 You don’t have to ‘Kermit’ or anything.
<kermit But you seem like the type who’d appreciate my contributions to society.
<self I nod frantically in response, taking a hold of his hand as he whisked me out of the auditorium.
I was able to get The Kermit the Frog to ask me out on a date.
The most handsome of frog memes.
I couldn’t be happier.
<scene


<kermit <exp 4 <self Kermit then sighed loudly, holding his hand against his head in disappointment. *Sad sprite*
<kermit Look <play...
<kermit I am a famous frog.
<kermit I can’t just go around dating any fan that comes my way.
<kermit Therefore we can’t ever be together.
<self He picked up a unicycle that was leaning against a nearby chair, before going outside and riding into the sunset like the meme Dat Boy.
<kermit <pos 0 <self I failed to pick up Kermit.
My frog meme boyfriend dreams are as good as dead.
